Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, 
and improving decision-making. From healthcare and finance to manufacturing and transportation, AI applications 
are revolutionizing how businesses operate. Machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer 
vision are some of the key technologies driving this transformation. Despite its advantages, AI also raises 
ethical concerns, such as data privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias. It is essential to develop 
AI systems responsibly to maximize their benefits while minimizing risks.
